# ðŸ”„ API to MySQL Data Integration with Python

This project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches user data from a public JSON API, transforms it into a structured format using Python, and loads it into a MySQL database.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This mini-project covers the full lifecycle of a data integration flow:

1. **Extract** â€“ Fetch raw JSON data from an API
2. **Transform** â€“ Flatten nested fields, clean column names, and create derived fields
3. **Load** â€“ Insert the cleaned data into a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy

The goal is to simulate a real-world pipeline that ingests API data into a relational database for further analysis or reporting.

## ðŸ“š What is ETL?

ETL stands for **Extract, Transform, Load**:
- **Extract**: Collect data from sources like APIs, CSVs, databases
- **Transform**: Clean, normalize, and enrich data to match business needs
- **Load**: Store the processed data into target systems like SQL databases or data warehouses

## ðŸ”— Data Source

We are using the free, public API provided by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users), which returns mock user data in JSON format.
